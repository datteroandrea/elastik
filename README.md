# Agile

# Setup


# How it works?


## Dependencies

Automatically installs the required dependencies (i.e. express)

## Version Control

By default agile uses git as the version control however you can choose to use git, other version control systems or none.
The settings of the version control of the project are saved in the config.json.
On every component initialization the agile framework creates a commit.

## Security

Agile installs dependencies to protect your web application (i.e. helmet, synk, nsp and retire.js).
Agile creates configuration files and protects your api keys and other web app private data.
